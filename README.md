An open-source add-on for previewing, searching, and collecting links to read later in a popup window. Source code available in releases or branches.


### FAQ

##### Is it possible to set a popup always on top?  
Due to browser add-on limitations, this can't be done directly by the add-on. However, you can use third-party software like **PowerToys** to achieve this. Don't forget to uncheck **"Close popup when origin window is focused"** on the settings page.

##### Why are other actions triggered during preview?  
Try disabling other add-ons to check if they are causing the issue. If you're using **Edge**, also check the settings at `edge://settings/superDragDrop`.
